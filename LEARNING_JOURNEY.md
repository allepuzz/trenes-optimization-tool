# Learning Journey: Tool → Agent → MCP

This document tracks the learning journey of building a Spanish train ticket optimization system, progressing through three phases of development.

## Project Overview

**Goal**: Learn the complete development pipeline from basic tool to intelligent agent to standardized MCP server

**Domain**: Spanish train ticket price optimization (Renfe, AVE, regional services)

**Timeline**: 14 weeks (structured learning phases)

## Phase 1: Foundation & Core Tool Development ✅

### Week 1-2: Setup & Architecture

**Completed:**
- [x] GitHub repository initialization
- [x] Python development environment setup
- [x] Project structure with proper packaging
- [x] Core data models (TrainRoute, PriceData, OptimizationResult)
- [x] Web scraping infrastructure with Playwright
- [x] Price optimization engine with statistical analysis
- [x] CLI interface for basic operations

**Key Learnings:**
- Pydantic models provide excellent type safety and validation
- Playwright offers robust web scraping capabilities
- Rich CLI library enhances user experience significantly
- Proper project structure is crucial for maintainability

**Tech Stack Implemented:**
- Python 3.11+ with modern packaging (pyproject.toml)
- Playwright for web scraping
- Pydantic for data modeling
- Click + Rich for CLI interface
- SQLite for local data storage

### Week 3-5: Core Tool Features (In Progress)

**Planned:**
- [ ] Renfe website scraping implementation
- [ ] Historical price data collection
- [ ] Statistical price analysis algorithms
- [ ] Database schema for price tracking
- [ ] Optimization recommendation engine
- [ ] Basic testing framework

**Current Status**: Foundation complete, ready for real-world scraping implementation

## Phase 2: Agent Development with LangGraph (Weeks 6-8)

### Planned Architecture:
```
User Query → LangGraph Agent → Tool Selection → Web Scraping/Analysis → Response
```

**Key Components to Build:**
- LangGraph workflow design
- Natural language interface
- Agent state management
- Multi-route comparison logic
- Intelligent scheduling
- User preference learning

## Phase 3: MCP Server Development (Weeks 9-11)

### Planned MCP Integration:
- Model Context Protocol server implementation
- Claude Code integration
- Tool definitions for train search
- Error handling and validation
- Performance optimization

## Phase 4: Polish & Publication (Weeks 12-14)

### Documentation & Release:
- Comprehensive API documentation
- Learning journey blog posts
- Video tutorials
- PyPI package publication
- MCP registry submission

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Framework Choice: LangGraph
**Reasoning**: Complex multi-step workflows with state management requirements
**Alternatives considered**: SmolAgents (too simple), LlamaIndex (RAG-focused)

### 2. Web Scraping: Playwright over Selenium
**Reasoning**: Better async support, faster execution, modern API
**Trade-offs**: Larger dependency footprint

### 3. Data Modeling: Pydantic v2
**Reasoning**: Type safety, validation, serialization
**Benefits**: Reduced bugs, better IDE support, clear data contracts

## Learning Resources

### Books & Documentation:
- LangGraph documentation and examples
- MCP specification and best practices
- Web scraping ethics and legal considerations
- Spanish train system documentation

### Code Examples:
- `src/trenes_tool/` - Core tool implementation
- `examples/` - Usage examples and demos
- `tests/` - Testing patterns and strategies

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Web Scraping Detection
**Problem**: Modern websites have anti-bot measures
**Solution**: User-agent rotation, request delays, headless browser detection avoidance

### Challenge 2: Price Data Reliability
**Problem**: Price changes can be frequent and inconsistent
**Solution**: Multiple data points, confidence intervals, trend analysis

### Challenge 3: LangGraph Learning Curve
**Problem**: Complex framework with many concepts
**Solution**: Start with simple workflows, gradually add complexity

## Metrics & Success Criteria

### Technical Metrics:
- [ ] Successful price scraping from 3+ train providers
- [ ] 90%+ accuracy in price trend predictions
- [ ] <5 second response time for basic queries
- [ ] MCP server compatibility with Claude Code

### Learning Metrics:
- [ ] Complete understanding of LangGraph workflows
- [ ] Ability to build production-ready MCP servers
- [ ] Published educational content helping others

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate (Week 3)**:
   - Implement real Renfe website scraping
   - Test with actual train routes and prices
   - Build price history database

2. **Short-term (Week 4-5)**:
   - Complete core tool functionality
   - Add comprehensive error handling
   - Implement basic optimization algorithms

3. **Medium-term (Week 6-8)**:
   - Design LangGraph agent architecture
   - Implement natural language interface
   - Add advanced optimization features

## Questions for Exploration

1. How can we ethically scrape train prices without violating terms of service?
2. What's the optimal frequency for price checking to balance data freshness with performance?
3. How can we make the agent truly intelligent in understanding user preferences?
4. What additional tools would be valuable in the MCP server?
